The first film to be released outside Japan from acclaimed director Hirokazu Koreeda (Nobody Knows; Shoplifters) is a simple, focused and engrossing drama perfectly suitable to the French reality. Based on a short story by Ken Liu, The Truth preserves the family topic (Koreeda’s favorite) well intact. The filmmaker works on this mature cinematic canvas with realism, probing in an effective way the ambivalent feelings that arise from a complex mother/daughter relationship. 

Fabienne Dangeville (the majestic Catherine Deneuve), a far-famed actress just released her memoir. For this reason, her daughter, Lumir (the natural Juliette Binoche), a scriptwriter living in New York, arrives with her American husband, Hank (Ethan Hawke), a minor actor with a drinking problem, and their daughter, Charlotte (Clémentine Grenier). In the meantime, Fabienne accepted to participate in a sci-fi film in which she acts alongside the trendy young actress Manon Lenoir (Manon Clavel). The film is also about a mother and a daughter, whose wounds need to be healed. In the meantime, Lumir gets shocked with the book’s inaccuracies.

Vanity, coldness and even abandonment are treated with candor by Koreeda, who is normally more interested in conciliate than to set apart. His peaceful tones and introspective ways find some beautiful, tender moments by the end. At that point, the film releases all the tension to hold a glimmer of optimism and forgiveness. This French experience might not have the strength of many of Koreeda’s domestic dramas, but there’s still a lot to appreciate here.
